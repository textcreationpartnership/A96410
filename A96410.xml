            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord, and worthy Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Committee of Safety, which are at pre≈øent intru≈øted with the Pre≈øervation of the Peace of this Commonwealth, are informed of ≈øeveral mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that relate particularly to the peace of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Commonwealth. Some pa≈ø≈øages whereof were lately delivered particularly to the Court of Aldermen: But other matters ≈øince coming to their knowledge, they thought it requi≈øite to communicate it to the Repre≈øentative of this Honorable and Worthy City for their advice, and to ≈øhew the Affections they particularly have thereunto, which I ≈øhall impart with plainne≈øs. I ≈øhall ≈øay nothing in commendation of that Ble≈ø≈øing, Peace, which you all know, being ≈øen≈øible of the calamities and troubles of a Civil War: You were once plea≈øed to make u≈øe of the Army, and with thankfulne≈øs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the good and benefit received by them, and this Honorable City contributed to that Work, for re≈øcuing of their Liberties, as Men and Chri≈øtians. It plea≈øed God to give us Peace; but the old Enemy, when he could not appear in his own ≈øtrength, ≈øought then by di≈øgui≈øe and underhand means to interrupt it. The In≈øurrection of Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> pretended ≈øpecious matters, which are ≈øince made plain, and their intentions di≈øcovered, which were onely to reduce us to ≈ølavery under Tyranny; but they were lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated: Now others are ≈øprung up of the like nature. The Rancour of the old Enemy is ≈øuch, that he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth all means imaginable to interrupt our Peace, and particularly in the City, knowing the Greatne≈øs, Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øne≈øs, and Wealth of it; all of you may be ≈øen≈øible of the great Calamities that will follow, if your peace be di≈øtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, which hitherto hath been pre≈øerved, and you have been free from acts of ho≈øtility. I ≈øhall propound ≈øomewhat for prevention. What man of ≈øober Principles, or fearing God, will hazard his Peace upon ≈øpecious groundle≈øs preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? in Sir <hi>George Booths</hi> bu≈øine≈øs there was a de≈øign to cau≈øe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168741:3"/>a Ri≈øing in the City, that upon a divi≈øion among your ≈øelves, men of de≈øperate fortunes, joyning with your Enemies might have the rifling of your City; as it was their cheife de≈øign to rai≈øe divi≈øion, ≈øo the ≈øame is now on foot The Committee of Safety have Intelligence to that purpo≈øe; (but alas! tho≈øe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py dayes, and ble≈ø≈øings we have received have not been ≈øo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by us, that we ≈øhould have any hope of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that ble≈ø≈øing, Peace!) It is evident by letters taken from private me≈ø≈øengers, that General <hi>Monk</hi> did ≈øend to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parties to ri≈øe at this time, and that in this City he ≈øhould have a Party to declare for him; but if it ≈øhould plea≈øe God, that ≈øuch a thing ≈øhould be, the dreadful con≈øequences thereof are unexpre≈ø≈øible. The Committee de≈øires you would take care of the pre≈øervation of the peace and ≈øafety of the City, wherein the ≈øafety of the Commonwealth is greatly concerned; you have been ≈øufficiently informed of the mi≈øery that follows ≈øuch di≈øturbances; there is nothing that concerns the Committee ≈øhall be omitted, but that they will contribute the utmo≈øt of their endeavours to prevent ≈øuch di≈øturbances; and are re≈øolved not willingly to be deficient in what they may do for the pre≈øervation of your Peace and Safety; for they have a particular re≈øpect and affection to this worthy City, and de≈øire, where any ground or occa≈øion is given of di≈ø≈øention, it may be laid a≈øide: And what ever people may cen≈øure of what is pa≈øt, let us look forward, and it will be made appear, that their aim is, That Magi≈øtracy, and a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mini≈øtry may be encouraged and ≈øupported. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee therefore de≈øires, That you would take ≈øpecial care to forbid any Meetings that tend to the ≈øetting on foot the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign of the Enemy. There are ≈øeveral Letters from the North read ye≈øterday, which certifie, That tho≈øe which are coming in ho≈øtile manner thought to have taken Newca≈øtle, but were prevented. A diligent care is taken about the≈øe things in other places. I wil onely in≈øtance that of a Divine, <hi>That where a great City is divided, great mi≈øeries may be expected:</hi> Therefore hazard not your ≈øafety, whatever ≈øpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be offered to you. I de≈øire that the≈øe things may be taken into con≈øideration, and that you would not be wanting to the <hi>Cau≈øe,</hi> and your own ≈øafety, which you have ≈øo long owned.</p>

            <head>The Lord <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> Speech.</head>
            <p>WE are once more to wait upon you; truly with de≈øire and ≈øincere Intentions, that there may be a right under≈øtanding between tho≈øe in Authority in this City, and the Armies of the≈øe Nations, as hath formerly been, and that they may ≈øtill remain an united Body: For the Common Enemy labours all he can to ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy both; and their only means to accompli≈øh their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign is Divi≈øion, and there is nothing ≈øo much as that can di≈øunite Old Friends. The City and Army had once the happine≈øs to e≈øteem one another as Friends; but now if any thing give occa≈øion of di≈øtru≈øt it will prejudice the <hi>Cau≈øe.</hi> You know this poor Army the Lord hath been plea≈øed to make u≈øe of as an In≈øtrument to pre≈øerve our Peace, ≈øo often attempted again≈øt: And we ≈øhould render our ≈øelves to be unworthy of the name of Friends if we ≈øhould ≈øeek our ≈øelves, and not the good of this poor Nation, and to get Rule and Dominion to our ≈øelves, and ≈øtand not to our Principles; the≈øe things are frequent di≈øcour≈øes: but if we had that Guilt which is ca≈øt upon us, we would not appear in ≈øo Honorable an A≈ø≈øembly. I dare ≈øay, Our de≈øign is Gods Glory: we have gone in untrodden paths, but God hath led us into wayes, which, if we know our own hearts, we have no ba≈øe or unworthy de≈øign in. Turnings and Changes are not plea≈øing to us; we have a Love to this Cau≈øe, and God hath ble≈øt us in it. It may appear that we have no de≈øign to Rule over others; we have been rai≈øed and pre≈øerved to this day upon Common account, and that your and our Liberty may not be Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated, although we have been cen≈øured, it hath been the de≈øign of our hearts (if we appear de≈øigning) to be no other then for the good of this Nation. We ≈øhall not want Enemies, but God will fight with us; let our Friends bear with us, and ob≈øerve the event. Nothing hath been more dear to us, then when God hath appeared to us, to continue Friend≈øhip and Peace, that ≈øo we may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168741:4"/>be helpful one to another. Our Enemies know the City hath more love to this <hi>Cau≈øe,</hi> then to comply with their ≈øpecious pretences. And whereas 'tis laid to our charge, That we are Enemies to parliaments; God he knows our de≈øign is to pre≈øerve the Ends of all Parliaments and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and, we hope, ≈øhall never appear to take away the Rights we have ≈øo long contended for. The great end of the Common Enemy, is to ruine the City, yet, by the help of God, we ≈øhall ≈øtudy your pre≈øervation. We hope that there may be a right under≈øtanding betwixt the Forces in the Northern Expedition; it ≈øhall not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us that the ≈øame may ≈øo be. Although it is our portion, that we cannot be more odious to our Friends then we are rendred, concerning the Nations Peace, yet there ≈øhall be nothing wanting in us for the ≈øettlement thereof; I would not have you to believe us ≈øo unworthy per≈øons, for we have no de≈øign but that Peace, Holine≈øs and Ju≈øtice may pro≈øper in this City and Nation.</p>

            <head>The Lord <hi>Disbrow</hi>'s Speech.</head>
            <p>I Was unwilling to ≈øpeak any thing; ≈øo much having been ≈øpoken by tho≈øe Honourable Per≈øons; but ≈øomewhat I mu≈øt ≈øpeak in Relation to what was hinted, and touching the Commands of the Committee of Safety: A great ≈øen≈øe there is upon the Committee of the difficulties this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øtruggles under; which are the greater, becau≈øe the common Enemy is in forwardne≈øs to a Birth, and bringing forth. It is the duty of all men as Chri≈øtians, and as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhmen, to value Peace the greate≈øt of outward enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; what I ≈øaid may be lookt upon as ≈øtrange, from one brought up for ≈øeveral years in martial Affairs; it being conceived of us, as of ≈øome in the beginning of the≈øe Troubles, that they feared nothing more, then that the Warrs would end too ≈øoon; it was the wickedne≈øs of tho≈øe men that had ≈øuch Principles, rather to gratifie filthy lu≈øts in their hearts, then for any good to the Commonwealth.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168741:4"/>I hope I may ≈øay of the generality of the Officers intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted in this Nation, that there is no outward thing more de≈øired by them, then to live to ≈øee tho≈øe ble≈ø≈øed foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid, ≈øo as to ≈øecure the Civil and Spiritual Rights of this Nation; nor is there any greater dread in them thereof (notwith≈øtanding that Blood≈øhed and expence they have undergone) then that they ≈øhall not ≈øee a ≈øettlement; yet we hope to God, (in de≈øpight of the Cunning of men) we ≈øhall ≈øee ≈øuch a ble≈ø≈øed Peace, as the Inhabitants of this Nation may ble≈øs his name. There is none ignorant, but that men (not wanting upon various accounts) make it their bu≈øine≈øs to hinder this ≈øo good a work; and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign is to oppo≈øe or interrupt a work the Providence of God is carrying on, to accompli≈øh their own de≈øigns. It is a mercy, whatever others judg, God hath born us wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, that we have not fal≈øifyed that Tru≈øt which hath been repo≈øed in our hands. Our difficulties have been ≈øuch, that the wealth of the City, ≈øhould not hire us to under goe them a year longer; but we may ≈øay, we are not without a mi≈ørepre≈øentation. Some ≈øay we are ≈øetting up Sectaries, this party and that party; but if we have guile in our hearts, and have not a love to the Godly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Nation, yea, to all the People, God will find us out: God hath ble≈ø≈øed ≈øome of us with a Spirit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and there is nothing upon our hearts, but the good of the whole. There is a twofold party in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, whom God hath again and again made bow down before his People, yet are ≈øtill labouring to heighten their ≈øpirits: <q rend="inline">We have not made them ≈ølaves, (which in ≈øome places is practi≈ø'd in the like ca≈øe) nor is it upon our ≈øpirits ≈øo to do; yet I think it our duty not to ≈øuffer them to give Laws to us, if God gives us leave to prevent it, and though we have it not in our hearts to do any thing to di≈øtingui≈øh, yet we are re≈øolved never to put our hands under the feet of tho≈øe we have vanqu≈øht: Some ≈øay we ≈øhall not have ≈øettlement, till the Old Family comes in, which if it ≈øhould enter into any of our hearts, we ≈øhould be like the Dog returning to his Vomit, and the Sow to her wallowing in the Mire.</q> Many, by the

Some give out as if we were returning to a ≈øingle Per≈øon, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to deba≈øe Magi≈øtracy, and trample down Mini≈øtry; but God will bear us witne≈øs to the contrary; The Truth of it is, we are ≈øo far from undervaluing of a Government, that we alwayes thought a bad one with Peace, better then none at all. If Peace be a great and choice ble≈ø≈øing to be valued by all, we de≈øire that you (with us) will take care to pre≈øerve it; we come not to Court you, but only to let you know, we have no de≈øign in it: Twas no prepared bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, that of Di≈ø≈øolving the Parliament, We hope that God ≈øtood by us in it, notwith≈øtanding there hath been many gloomy dayes ≈øince. The ≈øtrength of an Army is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; and it will be your ≈øafety and advantage to keep Unity; a City divided cannot ≈øtand: You will not want a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from the Army, if interruptions come in this place; whatever calamities may be el≈øewhere, they will not be ≈øo great here. Your Intere≈øt as Chri≈øtians, your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, your E≈øtates, are great engagements to pre≈øerve the Peace: If you go about, or others Countenanced by you, to di≈øturb it, an Inconvenience may fall upon you; but our de≈øire is you would not fling dirt on the Army, but as you ≈øee the i≈ø≈øue of their actions, ≈øo to judge of them. Many O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions may run, touching our dark Actions in the late alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and di≈øturbance: As to the fir≈øt it is evident, they had no de≈øign of their own; and in the la≈øt, if they would have complyed with a few men to ≈øet them up, they needed not to have wanted Re≈øpect. It is ≈øaid, it was only to keep eight or nine in their places; it is very well known, ≈øome of us have laboured an opportunity to be quit of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Now it is my de≈øire, that you would follow after Peace, and meddle not with Affairs beyond your Spheres, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Peace and Holine≈øs, and the God of Peace wil ble≈øs you.</p>
